# CSS Pre-Processors

In 1996, a standards committee initially defined the specification for how all web browsers should display the various aspects. Since there are many different web browsers and you want web pages to be consistent across all web browsers, the W3C (the World Wide Web Consortium) created standards.

Since then, developers wanted to add additional features to CSS. So they built additional languages that get converted into regular CSS. This transformation is known as CSS Pre-Processing. That’s because web browsers don’t actually understand this code, but they don’t need to since it’s written in a different language.
